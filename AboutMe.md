Hi i'm Saitej. I've done my undergrad in Electronics from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University. Right after my bachelors i worked as a Associate Software Developer at NTT DATA. I was predominantly working on server side development using .Net with C# programming language. After working for 2years i've decided to get a graduation degree in Computer Science in one of the reputed universities in USA.
